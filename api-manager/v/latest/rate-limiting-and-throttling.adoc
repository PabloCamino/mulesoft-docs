= Rate Limiting and Throttling

You link:/api-manager/using-policies#applying-and-removing-policies[configure and apply] the Rate Limiting policy to limit the number of requests an API accepts within a period of time. The API rejects requests that exceed the limit.

The Throttling policy is similar to the Rate Limiting policy, except requests that exceed the limits enter a queue for possible processing in a subsequent period. The API eventually rejects the request if unable to process it after a certain number of attempts. You can configure a delay between attempts to retry processing rejected requests, as well as a limit on the number of retries.

The Rate Limiting and Throttling policies impose a limit on all requests. The link:/api-manager/rate-limiting-and-throttling-sla-based-policies[SLA-based Rate Limiting and Throttling] policies manage the requests based on the level of access granted to the requesting application.

== Adjusting the Rate Limit for Multiple Workers

Under the following conditions, you need to divide the rate limit by the number of workers and configure the result as the rate limit:

* An application uses multiple workers that cannot share usage data, which is the case in a non-clustered environment (cloud or on-premises).
* The application workload is equally distributed across the workers.
+
Use a load balancer that distributes requests equally.

== Rate Limiting and Throttling in a Mule cluster

When either of these policies is applied to a clustered environment a component called *cluster quota manager* is kicked in. This component manages the quota you set and distributes it among each of the members of the cluster. This behavior implies that each node must request a quota allowance to the quota manager in order to serve requests, if that quota is exhausted it will have to request more. If the quota manager doesn't allow for more quota, then the node will not be able to handle any more requests.

Due to the normal latency in network communication, if you set a time period for request allowance that's too short it may happen that the time required to request and receive the quota between a node and the quota manager exceeds the quota lifetime and it will be already expired by the time it's received. Because of this we recommend not to use very short periods for these policies when running in a cluster. The minimal window would depend on many variables, such as workload and network speed, but as a rule of thumb period shouldn't be shorter than 20 seconds, a 1 minute period is recommended.
